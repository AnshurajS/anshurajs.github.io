								<p>Hello! I am Anshuraj Sedai, a senior undergraduate student at Caldwell University, NJ. I am double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics and minoring in Physics.</p>
								<p>An aspiring astrophysicist, I am actively applying to graduate school in astronomy, astrophysics and planetary sciences. I have previously conducted research on exoplanet atmospheric characterization and retrievals using machine learning models. I have also investigated the metal abundances during galaxy evolution. I have utilized 20-m radio telescope at Green Bank Observatory to measure and analyze data from deep-sky objects.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Research</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>MIT Summer Research Program (MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, 2025)</h3>
								<p>As an undergraduate research intern, I built physics-informed neural surrogate models trained on MCMC + petitRADTRANS spectra and validated them on benchmark exoplanets (HD 189733 b, GJ 1214 b). Working with research supervisor Dr. Prajwal Niraula and faculty mentor Dr. Sai Ravela, I identified key molecular features (e.g., CO, CO₂) and compared model outputs against observations—achieving large speedups over traditional Bayesian retrievals while preserving high fidelity.</p>
								<h3>NSF Cyberinfrastructure Compass Fellowship (CICF, 2025)</h3>
								<p>Through this fellowship, I strengthened my foundations in Python, software engineering, cloud computing, data workflows, and machine learning. I also developed a working understanding of the cyberinfrastructure that underpins NSF Major Facilities—covering instruments, storage systems, data repositories, and visualization environments—and how that ecosystem supports reproducible, scalable research.</p>
								<h3>University of Maryland — with Dr. Thaddeus Komacek (Summer 2024)</h3>
								<p>I investigated atmospheric escape and water loss for M-dwarf exoplanets (LHS 1140b, GJ 806b) using VPLanet to model system evolution and Python tools to analyze desiccation timescales. I also gained hands-on observational experience by operating a 20-m radio telescope at Green Bank Observatory to acquire and analyze deep-sky data, complementing my modeling work.</p>
								<h3>University of Maryland — with Dr. Mia Bovill Group (Spring 2024)</h3>
								<p>I studied the chemical evolution of nearby galaxies with Galacticus (a semi-analytic model), focusing on how metal abundance changes across cosmic time. I parsed and explored halo catalogs (HDF5) in Jupyter and visualized trends with Matplotlib, validating model behavior against observed galaxy properties.</p>
								<h3>Rutgers University — Center for Advanced Biotechnology & Medicine (Summer 2023)</h3>
								<p>Under the mentorship of Dr. Vikas Nanda, I evaluated AlphaFold2 on fold-switching protein pairs by writing Python pipelines to curate sequences (FASTA), generate predicted structures, and assess them with TM-align and ChimeraX. The project sharpened my interest in ML for scientific discovery and built transferable skills in data cleaning, structural analysis, and workflow automation.</p>
								<h3>International Astronomical Search Collaboration (2019–2023)</h3></h3>
								<p>As a citizen scientist and mentor, I used Astrometrica to reduce FITS images and track NEO candidates, training 120+ participants to analyze Minor Planet Center data. I contributed to the discovery of four provisional Main Belt asteroids—2021 RE95, 2021 UR119, 2022 JQ6, and 2022 QW271—and helped broaden access to hands-on astronomical data analysis.</p>

							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am an avid enthusiast of astronomy and space science. My research interests span from exoplanetary sciences to radio astronomy. I utilize my computational background to solve different problems or develop tools to optimize the process of problem solving in astronomy. </p>
								<p>Growing up in the southeast plains of Nepal, I developed a fascination towards astronomy with the majestic night sky I could see from my hometown. I moved to the capital city for my high school and I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Physics from Caldwell University.</p>
								<p>Outside of academics, I enjoy solving puzzles, doing astrophotography, hiking, playing and watching soccer.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Outreach</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Local Lead — NASA International Space Apps Challenge at Caldwell (Jul 2024–Present)</h3>
								<p>We launched Caldwell University’s inaugural 36-hour NASA International Space Apps Challenge, a global hackathon which achieved the highest registrations on the U.S. East Coast and 4th-highest nationwide. I led outreach, recruitment, logistics, and a dedicated volunteer team to deliver a seamless participant experience.</p>
								<h3>Founding President — Caldwell Astronomy Club (Mar 2023–Aug 2025)</h3>
								<p>We grew a vibrant campus astronomy community through marquee events—including a solar-eclipse viewing with 400+ participants—regular stargazing nights, and invited talks by distinguished astrophysicists; the club earned “Best Club” and “Best Event” for two consecutive years.</p>
								<h3>Vice President — Honors Program Student Board (Apr 2023–Apr 2025)</h3>
								<p>Our team organized professional-development workshops on internships and conferences, mentored first-year students, and led community-building events to strengthen peer belonging and engagement across the Honors community.</p>
								<h3>Nepal Astronomical Society — Academic Committee Member (Aug 2021–Present)</h3>
								<p>I contributed to drafting Observation-section questions for the 3rd IOAA-jr (2024) in Kathmandu, Nepal and mentored national delegates for multiple International Olympiads in Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA) and International Astronomy Olympiads (IAO), focusing on observational and positional astronomy.</p>
								<h3>Nepal Astronomical Society — Student Outreach Coordinator (Mar 2022–Aug 2022)</h3>
								<p>I led astronomy workshops in 15+ under-resourced communities, designed a tactile astronomy session for visually impaired learners using hand-made 3D celestial models, and co-authored a multilingual tutorial on sundials, planispheres, and telescope operation.</p>
								<h3>Nepal Astronomical Society — Content Writer / News Anchor (Apr 2021–Aug 2022)</h3></h3>
								<p>I researched, wrote, and presented 50+ Nepali-language episodes covering astronomy news and current affairs, broadening public access to space-science storytelling.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Peer Tutor — Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science (Caldwell University, Feb 2023–Present)</h3>
								<p>I support students across 15+ advanced courses—ranging from physics and astronomy to Calculus I–IV, linear algebra, and database systems—by breaking down tough concepts, modeling problem-solving strategies, and reinforcing study habits. To date, I’ve guided 100+ students through 1:1 and small-group sessions tailored to course goals and assessment timelines.</p>
								<h3>Laboratory Instructional Assistant — General Physics II (Caldwell University, Jan–May 2025)</h3>
								<p>I facilitated and designed experiments, prepared apparatus and materials, guided students on measurement and uncertainty, maintained a safe lab environment, assisted with computational analysis, and supported grading—helping students connect theory to hands-on investigations in optics, waves, and electromagnetism.</p>
								<h3>Supplemental Instructor — Calculus I (Caldwell University, Aug 2023–Dec 2024)</h3>
								<p>I designed and led structured SI sessions (~8 hrs/week) targeting high-friction topics, using guided inquiry, collaborative problem solving, and “redirecting questions” techniques to promote active learning. Iterative reflection and revision of session plans improved alignment with lecture pacing and strengthened peer-to-peer learning communities.</p>
